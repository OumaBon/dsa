real-world scenario or problem, requiring an understanding of how hash tables can be applied efficiently.

1. Implementing an LRU Cache (Caching System)
Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using hash tables and a doubly linked list. The cache should support the following operations:

get(key): Fetch the value of the key if it exists in the cache. Otherwise, return -1.
put(key, value): Insert or update the value of the key. If the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
The cache should operate in O(1) time for both operations.

Bonus: Handle scenarios where the cache needs to be distributed across multiple servers.

2. Designing a Symbol Table for a Compiler
You are tasked with implementing a symbol table for a new programming language's compiler. The symbol table must store variables, functions, and classes with the following operations:

addSymbol(symbol, type, scope): Add a symbol to the symbol table with its associated type and scope.
lookup(symbol): Retrieve information about a symbol, including its type and scope. If the symbol is not found, return an error.
The symbol table must handle nested scopes (e.g., functions inside functions) and support efficient lookup for variables in the most recent scope.

3. Find Anagrams in a Large Dataset
Given a large dataset of words (in the order of millions), design an efficient algorithm to group all anagrams together using a hash table. Your solution should:

Use a hash function that allows you to group words with the same set of characters.
Optimize both time and space complexity.
Handle edge cases where words have different lengths but could still be anagrams of one another.
Bonus: Extend the solution to handle streaming input, where new words keep arriving in real-time.

4. Optimizing Web Cache with Hash Tables
You are responsible for designing a caching system for a large-scale web application, which caches frequently accessed URLs. The cache needs to:

Track the frequency of access for each URL using a hash table.
Evict URLs based on a combination of LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) policies.
Design a system that efficiently handles millions of concurrent requests and evicts items in O(1) time.

5. File System Metadata Lookup
In a large-scale file system (e.g., Linux ext4), files are stored in directories, and each file has metadata associated with it. Design a hash table-based directory lookup system that:

Supports fast retrieval of file metadata (e.g., file size, last modified time) based on the file's name.
Handles hash collisions effectively, ensuring the system scales well as more files are added.
Supports nested directories and can handle directory paths like /home/user/documents/file.txt.
Bonus: Optimize the system for situations where millions of files are frequently added or removed from the directory.

6. Detecting Duplicates in a Distributed System
You are tasked with building a distributed system that processes millions of transactions every second. The system must detect and discard duplicate transactions in real-time. Implement a solution using hash tables that:

Can handle distributed transactions across multiple servers.
Ensures no duplicates are processed, even if they arrive at different servers.
Optimizes for minimal memory usage, given the massive scale of data.
Bonus: Ensure fault tolerance and recovery in case one of the servers fails.

7. Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Substring Search
Implement the Rabin-Karp algorithm to search for all occurrences of a given pattern in a large text. Your solution should:

Use a rolling hash to compute the hash values of substrings efficiently.
Handle hash collisions gracefully.
Optimize for cases where the text and pattern are very large (e.g., in the order of gigabytes).
Bonus: Extend the solution to search for multiple patterns at once, using a dictionary of hash tables to store the hash values of each pattern.

8. Consistent Hashing for Load Balancing
Design a load-balancing system that uses consistent hashing to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers. Your design should:

Map client requests (based on IP addresses) to servers using a hash function.
Ensure minimal disruption when servers are added or removed from the system.
Support millions of requests per second and provide O(1) lookup time for assigning a request to the appropriate server.
Bonus: Handle server failures gracefully and redistribute traffic accordingly.

9. Design a Resume Deduplication System
Build a resume deduplication system for an HR platform where candidates can upload their resumes. The system must detect duplicate resumes using hash tables, considering:

Resumes may have slight differences (e.g., formatting changes or synonyms), but the system should still flag them as duplicates.
Optimize for scalability, as the platform handles millions of resumes.
Handle cases where multiple resumes are being uploaded simultaneously.
Bonus: Allow the system to suggest potential duplicates with a similarity score, even when the resumes are not exactly the same.

10. Design an Autocomplete System
Implement an autocomplete system that suggests words based on a prefix entered by the user. Your system should:

Use a hash table to map prefixes to a list of possible completions.
Optimize for fast lookup and minimal memory usage.
Support real-time suggestions as the user types each character.
Bonus: Improve the system by ranking suggestions based on the frequency of usage and personalizing suggestions for each user.

11. Two-Sum with Multiple Arrays
You are given several sorted arrays and a target sum. Design an efficient algorithm to find pairs of numbers, one from each array, that sum up to the target. Your solution should:

Use hash tables to optimize the lookup time for each potential pair.
Work efficiently with arrays of varying lengths.
Handle edge cases where no pairs exist.
Bonus: Extend the problem to find k-sums, where k arrays are involved.

12. Cryptographic Hashing for Passwords
Design a system for securely storing and verifying passwords using hash tables and cryptographic hash functions. Your solution should:

Hash passwords with a salt to prevent rainbow table attacks.
Support fast password verification while ensuring the system remains secure against brute force attacks.
Handle password resets securely, ensuring the old hash is invalidated and a new hash is generated for the updated password.
Bonus: Implement rate-limiting to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the login system.

13. Optimizing Routing Tables in Routers
Design a router's routing table that uses hash tables to quickly look up the next hop for an IP address. Your system should:

Store IP address ranges and map them to corresponding next hops.
Optimize for fast lookups even as the network grows in size and complexity.
Handle IP address collisions (different devices with the same hash).
Bonus: Implement failover handling in case a next hop becomes unavailable.

14. Distributed Data Deduplication
Build a distributed deduplication system that can handle large amounts of data across multiple servers. Your system must:

Use hash tables to detect duplicate blocks of data across different servers.
Ensure minimal bandwidth usage by detecting and avoiding the transmission of duplicate data.
Handle edge cases where slight modifications in the data result in different hash values.
Bonus: Implement data redundancy and recovery in case some servers fail.
